# Restaurant POS System

## Introduction
This project is a simple Restaurant Point of Sale (POS) system designed to assist physical stores in completing transaction checkout processes. It is developed as part of my coursework, focusing solely on the transaction functionality. The system is tailored to the menu of **星馬快餐 (Sin Ma Express)**, serving as a reference for my homework content.

## Features
This system includes the following functionalities:
- **Form Controls**: Contains controls such as `groupBox`, `checkBox`, `radioButton`, `Button`, `Label`, and `textBox`.
- **Logical Grouping**: Uses `groupBox` to organize related options like `checkBox` and `radioButton`.
- **Menu Selection**: Provides at least 4 main dishes, 2 side dishes, and 2-3 drinks.
- **Amount Calculation**: Automatically calculates the actual consumption amount based on the user's order.
- **Form Title**: The title of the form is named as "Department_Student ID_Name".
