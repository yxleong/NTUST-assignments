# C# Swap Program

## Overview

This repository contains a simple C# console application that demonstrates how to swap the values of two integer variables. The program uses a temporary variable to exchange the values of `a` and `b` and prints the results before and after the swap.

## Code Description

The code performs the following steps:

1. Initializes two integer variables, `a` and `b`, with values `5` and `10`, respectively.
2. Prints the values of `a` and `b` before swapping.
3. Uses a temporary variable to swap the values of `a` and `b`.
4. Prints the values of `a` and `b` after swapping.

## Output
When you run the program, you should see the following output:
```
before swapping: a = 5, b = 10
after swapping: a = 10, b = 5
```
