# Variables and Constants Program

## Overview
This C# console application demonstrates the use of variables and constants. It showcases character and integer conversions, string manipulation, and calculations involving a constant value.

## Code Description
The program performs the following actions:
1. Initializes a character variable and an integer variable based on the character.
2. Displays the values of the character and integer variables.
3. Converts the character to an integer and vice versa.
4. Demonstrates string manipulation with different formatting options (tab and newline).
5. Uses a constant for the value of PI to calculate the circumference and area of a circle based on a given radius.

## Output
When you run the program, you should see:
```
character variable ch is A
integer variable i is 65
convert character variable ch to integer is 65
convert integer variable i to character is A
