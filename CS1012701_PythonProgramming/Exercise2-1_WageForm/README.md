# Employee’s wage

## Problem statement
An employee’s total weekly pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours plus any overtime pay. Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage.

### What do to
1. Write a program that takes as inputs the hourly wage, total regular hours, and total overtime hours and displays an employee’s total weekly pay. 

2. You should write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe:
    - what the program will do (Analysis)
    - how it will do it (Design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm).

3. Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately.

### Output
After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

The output is shown below:
```
Enter the wage: $100
Enter the regular hours: 8
Enter the overtime hours: 4
The total weekly pay is $1400.00
```
