# Linking Writing Processes to Writing Quality

## Project Overview
Hosted by Vanderbilt University in collaboration with The Learning Agency Lab, this competition aims to leverage process features from keystroke logs to predict overall writing quality and uncover connections between learners' writing behaviors and their performance. Participants are tasked with developing a predictive model using a substantial dataset of keystroke logs, providing insights into the potential impact of typing behavior on essay outcomes.

## Dataset Description

The competition dataset consists of logs from approximately 5000 user inputs, including keystrokes and mouse clicks during essay composition. Each essay is scored on a scale from 0 to 6. The dataset includes the following files:

1. **train_logs.csv**: Contains user input logs during essay composition, including event details, actions, and other relevant information.
2. **train_scores.csv**: Provides essay scores, which serve as the target variable for the prediction task.
3. **test_logs.csv**: Similar to `train_logs.csv`, but used for making predictions on unseen data. The public version includes only example logs to illustrate the format.
