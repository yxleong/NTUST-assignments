## Course Objectives
This course aims to introduce students to fundamental models and methods of data analysis. It will cover commonly used data analysis and visualization packages in Python and R programming languages. Students will learn how to apply these techniques and tools to analyze real-world data, helping users solve practical problems or provide value-added services. The course's goal is to familiarize students with common data analysis methods and tools. Through group projects, students will gain experience in analyzing real data and develop problem-solving skills.
