# Set Exercise

## Problem Statement
Consider a text file of names with one name per line, and the names have been collected from several different sources.

A sample is shown in the following: 

```
Brooke Trout 
Dinah Soars 
Jed Dye 
Brooke Trout 
Jed Dye 
Paige Turner 
```

There are duplicate names in the file. We would like to generate an invitation list but do not want to send multiple invitations to the same person.

Write a program that eliminates the duplicate names by using the set template class. Read each name from the file (`name.txt`) and add it to the set, then output all names in the set to generate the invitation list without duplicates. 


## Input
Read the file named "name.txt".
```
name.txt
```

## Output
```
Brooke Trout
Dinah Soars
Jed Dye
Paige Turner
```
