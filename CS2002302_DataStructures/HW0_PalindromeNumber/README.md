# Palindrome Number
## Description
A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In other words, it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Given an integer `X`, decide whether `X` is a palindrome number.

### Example 1

Input: `383`

Output: `383 is a palindrome number.`

Explanation: 383 reads as 383 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2

Input: `-383`

Output: `-383 is not a palindrome number.`

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -383. From right to left, it becomes 383-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome number.

## Input
An integer `X`, -2147483648 < X < 2147483647

## Output
If `X` is a palindrome number, output "X is a palindrome number."

Otherwise, output "X is not a palindrome number."

## Sample Input

```
383
```
```
-383
```
```
12
```

## Sample Output

```
383 is a palindrome number.
```
```
-383 is not a palindrome number.
```
```
12 is not a palindrome number.
