# Occurrence Counting

## Problem Statement
Write a program that reads a list of integers and counts how many times each number appears in the list. The program should output a two-column table sorted in descending order by the count value. The first column should contain the list of all numbers, and the second column should contain the count of each of them.

### Input
The input will consist of a list of integers, separated by spaces or newlines. The number of entries is not limited, but it will not exceed the memory limit of the program.

### Output
The output should consist of a two-column table, where the first column contains the list of all numbers sorted in descending order by their count value, and the second column contains the count of each of them. The table should be separated by a tab (\t).

### Sample Input / Output

Input:
```
-12 3 -12 4 1 1 -12 1 -1 1 2 3 4 2 3 -12

13 8 -4 0 8 -8 8 -1 12 0
```
Output:
```
N     Count
4     2
3     3
2     2
1     4
–1     1
–12     4

N     Count
13     1
12     1
8     3
0     2
-1     1
-4     1
-8     1
```
