# Computes the average and standard deviation

## Problem Statement

Write a function that computes the average and standard deviation of input scores. The standard deviation is defined to be the square root of the average of the input values: (s_i - m)^2, where m is the average of the input scores s_i, i = 1, â€¦, n. Note that the number of input scores should be dynamic.

### Input

The first input is n, followed by n integers s_i, where i = 1 to n. The input should be read from standard input.

### Output

Output the Average and Standard deviation, separated by a tab. The output should be printed to standard output.

### Sample Input / Output

Input:
```
5 1 2 3 4 5
6 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
```
Output:
```
Average:3	Standard deviation:1.41421
Average:3.5	Standard deviation:1.70783
Average:7	Standard deviation:0
```
