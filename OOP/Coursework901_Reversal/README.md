# Reversal

## Problem Statement
A text file contains an alphabetically sorted list of English words. Write a C++ program that **reads the words** in this file and finds the longest word that reverses to a different word. 

For example, "stun" reverses to make the word "nuts" but is only four letters long. 

Find the longest such word.

### Input
The input should be the words in text file.

### Output
The output should be the longest word that reverses to a different word.

## Note
* Read the list of words from the file into an array or vector and then search the array or vector for the reversed word. 
* Depending upon the speed of your computer and your implementation, execution of this program may take from minutes to hours.
* Note that the words in the file are in mixed upper and lowercase.

## Additional Information
* Medium, multiple programming grammars and structures are required.
* Solving time: 20 minutes
