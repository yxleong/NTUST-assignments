# Large Integer Operation

## Problem Statement
Large number computation involves performing calculations on numbers that are beyond the typical range of numerical values. This process requires special data structures and algorithms to process extremely large data, avoiding loss of numerical precision or range limitations.

In this problem, you are given two integers `a` and `b`. Please perform the following operations on these numbers:
**Addition**: compute the sum of `a` and `b`
**Subtraction**: compute the difference between `a` and `b`
**Multiplication**: compute the product of `a` and `b`

Note that `a` and `b` can be very large numbers, with more than 200 digits.

Write a program to perform these computations and output the results as integers.

## Input
The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`.

```

## Output
Output three integers representing the sum, difference, and product of `a` and `b` respectively.
